* The Tethered-Sat 2A team held its first project meeting to discuss deployment mechanisms for the satellite. The group initially considered using a drone system, either mounted on the side or bottom of the satellite and released through a servo-activated trapdoor, with a potential housing size of 2U to accommodate the design. After discussion, the team decided to move forward with a guided parafoil deployment system. Unlike a passive parachute, this system will incorporate mechanisms to create controlled swaying, enabling remote steering during descent.
* Cameras and altitude sensors will be included, along with a spring-loaded parafoil release system, though the exact deployment method is still under consideration.&#x20;
* To organize the project, four subsystem teams were established: Communications, focusing on aviation and camera integration; Mechanical, covering motors, servos, and CAD design; Guided Parafoil, responsible for motorized control of the parafoil; and a separation system team, tasked with developing a scissor-like snipping mechanism mounted separately from the 2U satellite but attached to the balloon, ensuring the satellite functions independently once released.

* Through this Tethered-Sat 2A team meeting there was progress in the discussions on what would be the final product as was mentioned in the previous meeting on a goal that wanted to be achieved. With the design continue being a 2U satellite.
* With the bottom 1U part being where two cameras will be mounted, with one of the cameras being directly on the bottom panel facing and the second one being mounted on the one of the side panels. With the opposing panel having a customized structured side panel wall that will have trusses formation to hold the PCB stack that will be used. Allowing for quick and easy insertion of the PCB stack there will be slidable rail attachment to the structured walls.
* Focusing on the PCB stack itself, the first layer will contain all the modules that will be used from; ESP32, SD module, camera module, power distributor, and ready-to-launch switch. With the second layer being more focused on the power distribution and the direct to PCB terminal connectors. Such as connectors for the battery packs, servomotors, and cameras. Finally, with the final and third layer to this stack not actually being a PCB itself but inside a 3D-printed panel that will have aligned holes to stay connected to the stack. Which will be used as the mounting point for all the battery packs that will be used., allowing all the electronic components to stay as close as possible.
* Leaving 1U of the space of the satellite to be used for the control system of the parafoil. Which will be working by a horizontal like reel system powered by a servo which will be connected to a couple of the strings on the parafoil to allow sway to happen for a controlled guidance. With the other strings being attached to the top of the satellite through the top panel and its mounting points that will be used for stabilization.
* While the reeling system will only take-up to 0.5U of the free space, all other space will be equipped by the spring-loaded system that will allow the parafoil to pop out deploy. The scissor-like snipping mechanism stayed the same as the past meeting. Without any change to the design.
