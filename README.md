# Welcome to the KSC Wiki

We are Knights Satellite Club, the University of Central Florida's student-led CubeSat program. This is where we document everything about what we do to the benefit of anyone.

## Who is this for?

:white\_check\_mark: **KSC Members** - Get caught up on how the club works, what we've done, and start getting involved!\
:white\_check\_mark: **Other Student Groups** - Learn from our successes and mistakes, and do cool stuff!\
:white\_check\_mark: **Everyone** - Our mission is to accelerate space exploration through education; anyone counts!

## How to help?

* If you're a UCF student, join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/fjKyphuaht) and come to the next GBM or project meeting. We can't wait to meet you!
* If you are not a UCF student, feel free to join the Discord as well. Tell us where you are from, and we can discuss how you can help out. We love working with student groups from other schools.
* If you are interested in working with us in some other manner, send us an email at [collegiatespace.ucf@gmail.com](mailto:collegiatespace.ucf@gmail.com). We are always looking for partners to further our mission through collaborations or contributions. Knights Satellite Club is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, so all donations are tax-deductible.
