### Week 1 (9/16/2025 & 9/18/2025)

* **9/16/2025 Meeting**
  * The Tethered-Sat 2A team held its first project meeting to discuss deployment mechanisms for the satellite. The group initially considered using a drone system, either mounted on the side or bottom of the satellite and released through a servo-activated trapdoor, with a potential housing size of 2U to accommodate the design. After discussion, the team decided to move forward with a guided parafoil deployment system. Unlike a passive parachute, this system will incorporate mechanisms to create controlled swaying, enabling remote steering during descent.
  * Cameras and altitude sensors will be included, along with a spring-loaded parafoil release system, though the exact deployment method is still under consideration.&#x20;
  * To organize the project, four subsystem teams were established: Communications, focusing on aviation and camera integration; Mechanical, covering motors, servos, and CAD design; Guided Parafoil, responsible for motorized control of the parafoil; and a separation system team, tasked with developing a scissor-like snipping mechanism mounted separately from the 2U satellite but attached to the balloon, ensuring the satellite functions independently once released.
