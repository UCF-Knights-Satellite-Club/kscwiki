<summary>Week 2 (9/23/25)</summary>

Date: 9/23/25

* Continuing from the meeting that took place on the 9/18 the T-Sat team decided to scrape the idea of the spring-loaded system. Instead, the discussion began about the idea of a top panel separation system.&#x20;
* With this idea it would involve the whole 2U satellite being separated from the top panel so the top panel can stay attached to the ballon with the whole 2U housing becoming its own system allowing for guided deployment. With another modification being the servomotor position that will be involved in controlling the guidance. Instead, it will be standing vertically for easier control in the sway with better stabilization even if there is much air resistance against the whole housing.&#x20;
* In creating the separation, which would be where the four servos will take place and be the stabilizing and mounting point for both systems. Each servomotor being mounted on each respective side panel with having an attachment. With the attachment that will be connected to the servomotors being a half cylindrical ring. With having a flat part that can be used to screw into the servomotors while the slide that would involve having contact with the part connected to room of system 2. Except instead of a complete ring, there will be an opening on the ring. With the part that would be connected to the roof of system 2 being a hook-like mechanism. The design would involve making it a hook, except if it is hanging upside down from the roof. In doing so the servomotor ring link would just be connected to the hook by inserting it through the opening of the ring then, rotating the servo so it is doing connection to the ring itself. Once commanded or desired altitude has been achieved and through confirmation of the team at the launch sight the servomotor will rotate to the opening in the ring allowing system 2 to become its own payload which goes into freefall and deploys the parafoil through air resistance.
* With the rest of the meeting involving just listing needed parts for this mission and finalizing the design, so the T-Sat 2A team lead can submit the Mission Concept Review (MCR) to the board for approval of the mission.

Date: 9/26/25

* As stated from the past meeting taking place on 9/23, the Mission Concept Review (MCR) was submitted to the board. Through further discussion between the board and T-Sat 2A team lead the decision involving how this mission would proceed was modified. With the main focus of T-Sat 2 being a mission project that can be completed in one school semester while being an introductory project for any members, it was decided the guided parafoil would push that deadline quite a bit and quite complicated for newer members. As such the team lead had to inform the rest of the team of the heart-breaking news.
* With the main focus of the project now being on the separation system that involves the top panel and the 2U CubeSat becoming its own system. As such there was a modification of the items needed for the mission which was the main focus of the meeting. Allowing there to be a start on the CADing for next meeting.

<summary>Week 3 (9/30/25)</summary>

Date: 9/30/25

* As stated, the previous meeting taking on 9/25 where the main mission had a bit of medication, which changed the parts list. Making confirming and finalizing the items needed for this mission the focus of the beginning of the meeting, which will be sent to the Knight’s Satellite Club (KSC) treasurer for approval.

- Once the budget list was completed, the CADing of the PCB and housing began. With most of the time being used to teach and allowing the team to get accustomed to each software. While each respective team brainstorming ideas on the design and assortment the housing was going to be created.

* At the same time the software team was looking back at previous T-Sat mission code to get an idea of how it was assorted. Which leads them to decide on creating a five-step calibration system for the mission. The first being **Calibration**, which will get started as soon as the ready-to-launch pin gets removed and will set the starting point as altitude zero. Once there is a gain in altitude the second step **Preflight** begins which is in waiting state for the third step **Ascend**. In the step is where the cameras will get activated and keep on taking pictures until **Freefall** state. This fourth step would involve the separation of the system that can be initiated by manual button or if it reaches a certain height of 400ft. The last step being **Landing** which will begin retaking pictures for the descent until the ready-to-launch is placed back in. Since the milliseconds between the **Freefall** state the pictures will stop to allow the servomotor command to begin. All while data of altitude and the pictures being record in an SD card.

- The next meeting will involve counting these three teams’ progression in CADing both housing and PCB. With start of writing code for the final flight and test code that will be used for testing hardware.

Date: 10/2/25

* The world may never know what happened on October 2nd, 2025 at the T-Sat 2A meeting.
