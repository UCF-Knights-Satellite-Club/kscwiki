# T-Sat-2

In the Tethered-Sat 2 mission, the team has decided to bifurcate the work into two focused sub-projects: **T-Sat 2A** and **T-Sat 2B**, each with its own scope but working toward the common mission goals.

* **T-Sat 2A** will concentrate on the _mechanical, deployment, and hardware systems_. This includes a controlled separation system with deployment by a parachute. Essentially, 2A handles everything needed to make the physical system fly, deploy, and behave safely and reliably with attachments such as on-board cameras and sensors.
* **T-Sat 2B** will be more focused on _optical, electronic, and software systems_. This covers the cameras, altitude sensors/readings, remote control / telemetry, possibly image capture and processing, and the software that will interpret data and drive control of deployment or parafoil steering. B will ensure strong integration of electronics and software to support the hardware platform designed by 2A.
