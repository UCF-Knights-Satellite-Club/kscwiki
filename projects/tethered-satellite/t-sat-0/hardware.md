# Hardware

## Overview

Our mechanical team worked on and iterated design using OnShape as our CAD platform. As a low cost and easy prototyping option we used 3D printing as our means of manufacturing. This gave us freedom while iterating and helped our relatively inexperienced team at multiple points in development as changes were made on the fly during testing or other points during development.
