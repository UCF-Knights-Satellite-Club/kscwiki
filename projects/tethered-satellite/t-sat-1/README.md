# T-Sat-1

Tethered-Sat-1 (T-Sat-1) is a refinement of [T-Sat-0](../t-sat-0/) and will fly the same experiment with some hardware and software upgrades. Integrating all the lessons learned from our previous launch and the [flight data](../t-sat-0/flight-results.md) recovered. Ultimately, hoping for parachute deployment at the proper altitude set in the software while T-Sat is in freefall, creating a smoother flight profile.

For the second flight we want to see improvements on the [Parachute Deployment System (PDS)](hardware.md) in its operation alongside [software](software.md) updates to eliminate the possibility of early parachute deployments with uncontrollable weather conditions. With plans for the software to solely operate on barometric readings for altitude. In addition, we want to improve our launch day operations and the usability of some of our hardware. Helping to increase the reliability of our PDS in flight, alongside reducing the stress of launch day.
