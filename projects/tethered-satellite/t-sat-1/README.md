# T-Sat-1

Tethered-Sat-1 (T-Sat-1) is a refinement of T-Sat-0 and will fly the same experiment with some hardware and software upgrades. Integrating all the lessons learned from our previous launch and the flight data recovered.&#x20;

For the second flight we wanted to see improvements on the Parachute Deployment System (PDS) and its operation alongside the refined software that solely operates on barometric readings.&#x20;
