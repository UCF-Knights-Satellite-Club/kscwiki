# Flight Results

## Overview

T-Sat-1 took flight from the UCF Arboretum on the morning of June 21st, 2025. The burnwire mechanism worked correctly allowing the parachute to deploy successfully and at the correct altitude.

## Flight 1

The flight of T-Sat-1 began around 9:30 AM and reached a max altitude of roughly 125m (410ft).

Due to T-Sat-1 getting caught in a tree at the arboretum we were limited to a single flight. We were able to recover T-Sat a day later when one of our members climbed the tree and untangled the parachute.
