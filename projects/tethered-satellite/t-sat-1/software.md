# Software

Since T-Sat-1 used the same electronics as T-Sat-0, most of the software stayed the same.&#x20;





Couple of updates that were said in the discord chat

\~2/24/2024\
software was modified so it cut out the accelerometer software\
\~6/10/2025: yesterday i got image transfers down to 30 seconds or so. I was able to push the SPI frequency up to 16 MHz without issue but any higher and the SD card dies. Increasing the internal image buffer might speed things up now, not sure
