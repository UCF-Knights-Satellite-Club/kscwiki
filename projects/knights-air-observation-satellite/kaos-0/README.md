# KAOS-0

Initially utilizing a 3D printed housing KAOS-0 was launched August 13, 2022. Unfortunately a catastrophic failure occurred with another RSO's rocket that KAOS-0 was within.

As seen below the results were also catastrophic for our CubeSat without any of the data being recoverable. However this version was still valuable to our team and a lot of expertise was gained throughout every stage of version 0.
