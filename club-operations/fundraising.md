# Fundraising



## Florida Space Grant Consortium (FSGC)

{% hint style="info" %}
This information is specific to Florida. Information on your local Space Grant Consortium can be found on [NASA's Website](https://www.nasa.gov/learning-resources/national-space-grant-college-and-fellowship-project/consortium-directors).
{% endhint %}

FSGC has several [grant opportunities](https://floridaspacegrant.org/programs/higher-education/), but two are particularly relevant to KSC. The [Student Club Project Grant](https://floridaspacegrant.org/program/student-club-projects/) offers financial support for projects and the [Student Travel Grant](https://floridaspacegrant.org/program/student-travel-grant/) offers financial support for students traveling to present a paper or poster at a conference. FSGC funding is offered on a first come first serve basis so the sooner you apply the more likely FSGC will be able to accommodate your request. All requests must go through your institution's Sponsored Research Office so you need to work with faculty in order to apply for grants. If you think you qualify for an FSGC grant the best thing to do is contact the director, currently [Dr. Jaydeep Mukherjee](mailto:jaydeep.mukherjee@ucf.edu), and work with him to ensure you have the best chance at getting funding.

## UCF Student Government (SG)

SG offers several avenues for Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) to receive funding for their activities. SG requires applicants to have undergone [financial training](https://asf.sdes.ucf.edu/training/) which explains the details for different types of funding. Overviews of the opportunities here will be provided but the training will go into detail on current procedures. All funding comes in two forms: allocations and bills. Allocations are dispersed by the relevant committee within SG and have specific limits on the amount of funding available. If your request exceeds twice the allocation limit, it might be advantageous to try for a bill. Bills have much higher limits but only cover 50% of the expenses (which is why they only make sense at 2x the allocation limit) and must be voted on by the SG Legislative Branch making them a much more arduous process.

## Sponsorships

Sponsorships from local and relevant businesses offer a very powerful fundraising avenue. Some larger businesses have a specific sponsorship process, but working with most smaller companies usually means knowing for finding out who to contact. Direct connections such as friends or family working for a business are great places to start.&#x20;

### Blue Origin

Blue Origin provides annual sponsorships of  $1,000 to $3,000 to support student engineering teams and projects. Blue also provides technical mentorship to the teams it partners with. Applications are by invitation only; reach out to [Blue Origin University Relations](mailto:u@blueorigin.com) for more information.
