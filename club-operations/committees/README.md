# Committees

Committees are a way for Knight Satellite Club members to get involved with the day-to-day operations of the organizations. Each committee is led by a Committee Chair who is appointed by the Board each semester.

* The Committee Chair
  * May only be appointed for 2 Semesters in a row.
  * Is responsible for ensuring the Committee is fulfilling its clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
  * Is responsible for managing Subcommittee/Project Lead appointments.
  * Reports directly to and is assisted by one of the Officers on the Board.
* KSC members are free to participate in any committees and may be appointed to Subcommittee/Project Lead roles by each Committee Chair.

Committees can be created, modified, or disbanded at any time at the discretion of the Board. If there are no candidates for a Committee Chair, the Officer in which the Committee Chair would normally report to assumes the role of Committee Chair until a candidate is found.
